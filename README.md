wordpress-plugin
================

This plugin allows you to keep current location up to date on a WordPress.org travel blog. This plugin compliments your Oh Hey World profile.

You can access the plugin here: http://wordpress.org/plugins/oh-hey-world/

If you want to fork OHW into GitHub, you can do it pretty easily already w/ the built-in support for svn w/in git (http://git-scm.com/book/ch8-1.html).

If you feel there is a need to sync a code base of this plugin here on Git, please send me an email and let me know.
